# libchrysalis
libchrysalis is an attempt at a graphics abstraction layer in modern C

the headers serve as a standard that the implementations must follow and produce the exact same results

the library is documented, but still unusable for now. an OpenGL implementation is being developed in parallel as a testing ground
